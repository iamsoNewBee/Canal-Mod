# Canal-Mod
A mod about canals,

which could carry the water.

Not only do they moisturize your crops,

but also decorate your farm.

You say they are useless,

I say they are neccessary.

Yeah yeah, just do everyting with the powerful bucket.

And see what everything you have missed.

~~There are many bugs,~~

~~and shit mountain code.~~

(I have actually fixed most of bugs via my overworked brain and more shit code.)

so just Enjoy :)
